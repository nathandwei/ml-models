  notes: 'Demo model for Week 0 - Random Forest on synthetic data.


    This is a simple classification example to demonstrate the project structure.

    Used sklearn''s make_classification to generate synthetic data with 1000 samples,

    20 features, and 2 classes.


    Key takeaways:

    - Random forest works well on synthetic data (as expected)

    - Good baseline for future comparisons

    - Project structure is working well
